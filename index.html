                into business, we weren't getting the payback. So we knew we had to do something, and we both realised we weren't
                experts in business we've just worked for a company, and that was pretty much it. So we realised we needed a bit of
                help. The biggest benefit, it's pushed us to grow. Having a coach has almost been like employing a part-time CEO to come
                in and kick your butts when you're too comfortable, having a coach forced us into continual new areas, and the payoff
                for the business has been massive.</p>

                        business. I enjoy what I'm doing. I love what I'm doing. I wear every cap, though, and I needed to learn how to
                        delegate, prioritise and work out what I actually action first. Hence, I looked into doing work with a business coach.
                        The last six months working with Outcomes Business Group have been phenomenal. We've quadrupled our sales, our growth is
                        just going through the roof.</p>

                            very sceptical at first. When I started with outcomes, three years ago, we were six or seven permanent staff. And we
                            were turning over about three and a half million a year. Now we've got 14 permanent staff, and we're turning over this
                            year 7 million. It's very hard to succeed long term in today's competitive environment unless you've got a really clear
